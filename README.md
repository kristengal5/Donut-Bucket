# Donut-Bucket
I created this website in my Web Design class as a junior. 
I started by designing wireframes for this website using Adobe XD, editing photos for the website with Adobe Photoshop, and creating graphics with Adobe Illustrator. 
Then, I coded this website in Sublime Text using HTML and CSS. 
Students were assigned a fictitious company and tasked with designing and coding the website.
